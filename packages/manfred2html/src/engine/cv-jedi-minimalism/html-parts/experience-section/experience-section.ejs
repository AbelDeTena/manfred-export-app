          We grew the company from a recruiting agency to become a genuine career management platform. Now, we are
          an international team of 45 people, taking care of the career of +20,000 professionals around the World.
          To achieve this, we had to: Adapt the organization processes to scale its operations. Implementation of
          Holacracy as the management system. Development of own product to scale the company operations,
          especially the value added to candidates. Completing the acquisition process by Sngular, maintaining the
          company's core of employees without any productivity or sales suffering before, during, and after it.

          Comalatech was a company with 17 employees and 3 million dollar revenue per year, developing plugins
          that extend the functionalities of the Atlassian main products. My goal was to scale the organization to
          help grow. With these solid foundations, Comalatech was finally acquired by Appfire in 2022.
